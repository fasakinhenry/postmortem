intro:
- excerpt: 'A software postmortem is a process conducted at the end of a project or after a significant event, such as a major incident or failure. The goal is to analyze what went well, what didnâ€™t, and how processes can be improved in the future. This involves gathering data, discussing the outcomes with the team, and documenting the findings. By conducting postmortems, teams can learn from their experiences, avoid repeating mistakes, and continuously improve their workflows and practices. For more detailed information, you can refer to resources like [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/post-mortem).'
